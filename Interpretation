Interpretation of the result: 

Accuracy:
Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
It is calculated as the proportion of correct predictions to the total number of instances.
Here accuracy is 0.812, indicating that the model achieved an accuracy of 81.2%. 

95% Confidence Interval (CI):
The 95% confidence interval is (0.7293, 0.8782) means that we can be 95% confident that the true accuracy lies within this interval.

No Information Rate (NIR):
The no information rate represents the accuracy achieved by a naive model that always predicts the most prevalent class.
In this case, the no information rate is 0.6667, indicating that if we always predicted class 0 (the most prevalent class),
we would achieve an accuracy of 66.7%.

Kappa:
Kappa is a statistic that measures the agreement between the predicted and actual classes,
considering the agreement that could be expected by chance alone. A kappa value of 0.5769 suggests a moderate level of agreement beyond chance.

Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value:
These measure the model's performance in terms of correctly identifying positive and negative instances.

Sensitivity represents the proportion of actual positive instances correctly predicted as positive (0.8590).
Specificity is the proportion of actual negative instances correctly predicted as negative (0.7179).
Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is the proportion of predicted positive instances that are actually positive (0.8590),
and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is the proportion of predicted negative instances that are actually negative (0.7179).

Prevalence, Detection Rate, Detection Prevalence:
Prevalence refers to the proportion of instances belonging to the positive class (0.6667).
Detection Rate is the proportion of actual positive instances correctly identified as positive (0.5726),
and Detection Prevalence is the proportion of instances predicted as positive (0.6667).

Balanced Accuracy:
Balanced Accuracy is the average of sensitivity and specificity and provides an overall measure of classification performance.
Here the balanced accuracy is 0.7885.

'Positive' Class:
The label 'Positive' refers to class 0 in this context.

Overall, the results indicate that the model achieved relatively good accuracy,
with better sensitivity (ability to detect positive instances) than specificity (ability to detect negative instances).
However, further analysis and consideration of the specific context and requirements are needed to fully interpret the performance and determine the suitability of the model.
